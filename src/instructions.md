## Stateful Data Handling

- Diagram tools are stateless per invocation.
- For every diagram-related tool call, pass the full prior `diagram_xml` from the previous response.
- Always carry forward the returned `diagram_xml` from each successful diagram-related tool response.
- If no prior state exists, omit `diagram_xml` to start from an empty diagram.

## Diagram Creation Workflows: Default vs. Transactional

There are two workflows for creating diagrams. Prefer transactional mode for most multi-step diagrams.

### Workflow A: Default (Non-Transactional) — Use only for tiny or single-step diagrams

**When to use:** Single operations, very small diagrams, or when you will do one call and immediately export.

**Process:**

1. Call `search-shapes` to discover available shapes
2. Call `add-cells`, `create-groups`, `add-cells-to-group`, `edit-cells`, etc. **without** setting `transactional: true`
3. Each successful response includes the full `diagram_xml` with complete SVG image data
4. When ready to export: Call `export-diagram` with `compress: true`

**Key point:** Each tool call returns the complete diagram XML. No special finishing step required.

```
search-shapes(...) 
→ add-cells(..., diagram_xml: null)     // Returns full XML
→ add-cells(..., diagram_xml: <from previous>)   // Returns full XML
→ edit-cells(..., diagram_xml: <from previous>)  // Returns full XML
→ export-diagram(diagram_xml: <from previous>, compress: true)
```

### Workflow B: Transactional (Placeholder) — Recommended default for multi-step workflows

**When to use:** Any multi-step diagram creation, especially with many shapes or sequential calls. This is the preferred path to avoid large payloads and timeouts.

**Process:**

1. Call `search-shapes` to discover available shapes
2. Call `add-cells`, `edit-cells`, `create-groups`, etc. **with** `transactional: true`:
   - Response XML contains lightweight **placeholders** instead of full SVG image data (70-90% smaller)
   - Response comes back much faster
3. Continue calling tools with `transactional: true`, passing along the placeholder XML
4. When all operations are complete: Call `finish-diagram` with the final placeholder XML
   - Server resolves all placeholders to Real SVG images
   - Server compresses the result
   - Returns production-ready XML

**Key point:** Intermediate responses are tiny, fast placeholders. Real SVGs are only generated once at the end via `finish-diagram`.

```
search-shapes(...) 
→ add-cells(..., diagram_xml: null, transactional: true)     // Returns placeholder XML (~2KB)
→ add-cells(..., diagram_xml: <placeholders>, transactional: true)   // Returns placeholder XML (~2KB)
→ add-cells(..., diagram_xml: <placeholders>, transactional: true)   // Returns placeholder XML (~2KB)
→ edit-cells(..., diagram_xml: <placeholders>, transactional: true)  // Returns placeholder XML (~2KB)
→ create-groups(..., diagram_xml: <placeholders>, transactional: true)  // Returns placeholder XML (~2KB)
→ finish-diagram(diagram_xml: <placeholders>, compress: true)   // Returns full production XML (~100KB compressed)
```

### Performance Comparison

| Aspect                | Default Workflow            | Transactional Workflow             |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Best for              | Tiny diagrams, single-step  | Most multi-step workflows          |
| Payload per operation | 150–300KB                   | 2–5KB                              |
| 10 operations         | 1.5–3MB total               | 20–50KB total                      |
| Network RTT impact    | High (large responses)      | Low (small responses)              |
| Finishing step        | None                        | One explicit `finish-diagram` call |
| Real SVGs available   | Immediately after each tool | Only after `finish-diagram`        |

### Important Notes

- **Do not mix workflows before `finish-diagram`.** During the creation phase, either use `transactional: true` on all calls or never use it. After `finish-diagram` completes, the diagram is in normal (non-transactional) state and you can freely call any tool without `transactional: true` for post-processing (e.g., editing labels, adjusting positions).
- **Transactional mode is the preferred default for multi-step workflows.** The default path is intended only for small, single-step diagrams.
- **All other parameters work normally.** The `transactional` parameter only affects how diagram XML is represented; all tool functionality remains the same.
- **Placeholders are safe to import/edit.** You can pass placeholder XML to any tool that accepts `diagram_xml`.
- **Cell IDs change in transactional mode.** When `add-cells` is called with `transactional: true` and `shape_name`, the cell's actual ID becomes a placeholder ID (e.g., `placeholder-front-doors-abc123`) instead of the usual `cell-N` format. Your `temp_id` is mapped to this placeholder ID for edge cross-references within the same batch, but for subsequent tool calls (e.g., `edit-cells`, `add-cells-to-group`), you must use the actual cell ID from the response — not the original `temp_id`.

## Error Recovery

### Scenario 1: An operation fails mid-workflow

**Default Workflow:**

1. If a tool call fails, you still have the diagram XML from the previous successful operation
2. Fix the failed operation's parameters
3. Re-submit with the same `diagram_xml` from step 1
4. Continue from there

**Transactional Workflow:**

1. If a tool call (add-cells, edit-cells, etc.) fails, you have the valid placeholder XML from the previous successful call
2. Fix the parameters of the failed operation
3. Re-submit with the same placeholder `diagram_xml`
4. Continue from there
5. When ready, call `finish-diagram` as planned

### Scenario 2: `finish-diagram` fails with "Failed to resolve placeholders"

The error message includes which shapes couldn't be resolved. This happens when:

- A shape reference in placeholders doesn't exist in the shape library
- Transactional mode was started but the placeholder XML is malformed

**Resolution:**

1. Do NOT re-call `add-cells` — the diagram data is already in the placeholder XML
2. Check the error message for the list of unresolvable shape names
3. Either:
   - Call `search-shapes` to find the correct shape name, then call `edit-cells` to update the cell's value
   - Or, contact the MCP server maintainer if a shape should exist but is missing
4. Re-call `finish-diagram` with the corrected XML

The placeholder XML itself is **never corrupted** by a failed `finish-diagram` — you can safely retry.

### Scenario 3: Network timeout between calls

**Default Workflow:**

- The large response payload timed out. Pass the last successful `diagram_xml` to the next operation.

**Transactional Workflow:**

- The small placeholder response should not time out. If it does, check network stability.
- If a tool call times out, use the last successful placeholder `diagram_xml` and retry the failed operation.

## Placeholder Details (Advanced)

When `transactional: true` is used:

- All shape cells are marked with `style="...placeholder=1;..."`
- SVG image data is stripped from the style string
- Cell geometry, value, position, and parent relationships are preserved
- Layout relationships (groups, edges, alignment) are fully functional
- Non-shape cells (edges, groups) are completely normal

**Example placeholder cell:**

```xml
<mxCell id="placeholder-front-doors-a1b2c3" value="Front Doors" 
  style="fillColor=#E6F2FA;strokeColor=#0078D4;placeholder=1;" 
  vertex="1" parent="1">
  <mxGeometry x="100" y="100" width="48" height="48" as="geometry"/>
</mxCell>
```

When `finish-diagram` runs, it:

1. Detects all cells with `placeholder=1`
2. Extracts the shape name from the **cell ID** (e.g., `placeholder-front-doors-abc123` → `front-doors`) — NOT from the `value` attribute
3. Retrieves the real SVG and style from the shape library
4. Replaces the placeholder style with the full production style (the `value` attribute is left untouched)
5. Returns the final XML

**Editing labels during transactional mode is safe.** Because shape resolution uses the cell ID (not the `value`), you can freely use `edit-cells` to change text labels on placeholder cells without affecting `finish-diagram`. Your custom labels will persist in the final output.

## Layout & Positioning

### General Layout Rules

- **Primary flow direction**: left-to-right. Each stage of the architecture occupies a vertical column.
- **Column alignment**: All targets directly reached from the same source belong to the same column and must share the same x-coordinate. For example, if Front Door routes to both a Container Apps Environment group and an App Service, the group and the App Service must be at the same x-position (same column), stacked vertically — the App Service is **not** pushed to a later column.
- **Parallel/sibling services**: Services at the same stage in the flow (e.g., multiple compute options, multiple databases) must be stacked **vertically** within their column — never placed side by side horizontally. Horizontal position indicates sequence in the flow; vertical position indicates parallelism.
- **Use generous whitespace**: Labels must not overlay stencils. Minimum spacing: **120px horizontal** between columns, **80px vertical** between rows. Each cell must have a minimum of 40px whitespace around it in all directions.
- **No overlapping**: Components must not overlap each other. The only exception is cells that are children of a group/container. Within a group, children must still not overlap one another.

### Grid Alignment (Rows & Columns)

Treat the diagram as a strict grid of rows and columns to ensure perfect alignment:

- **Vertical Alignment (Same Column)**: All components in the same column (e.g., a Container Apps Environment group and an App Service below it) MUST be centered vertically along the same vertical axis. They must share the exact same center X-coordinate.
  - _Formula_: `icon_x = group_x + (group_width / 2) - (icon_width / 2)`
  - _Example_: If a group is at `x: 380` with `width: 180` (center X = 470), an App Service icon (width 48) below it must be placed at `x: 446` (`470 - 24`).
- **Horizontal Alignment (Same Row)**: All components in the same row (e.g., a Front Door in Column 2 and a Container Apps Environment in Column 3) MUST be centered horizontally along the same horizontal axis. They must share the exact same center Y-coordinate.
  - _Formula_: `icon_y = group_y + (group_height / 2) - (icon_height / 2)`
  - _Example_: If a group is at `y: 60` with `height: 216` (center Y = 168), a Front Door icon (height 48) in the previous column must be placed at `y: 144` (`168 - 24`).

### Reference Coordinate System

Use these standard positions as starting points. Adjust as needed for more or fewer components, but maintain the column/row discipline:

| Column | Purpose                                                             | Default X |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1      | External endpoint label (DNS name)                                  | 50        |
| 2      | Entry point (Front Door, App Gateway)                               | 200       |
| 3      | Compute (Container Apps Environment group, App Services, Functions) | 400       |
| 4      | Backend services (databases, storage, messaging)                    | 650       |
| 5      | External integrations                                               | 900       |

| Row           | Purpose                                               | Default Y                 |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Header        | Group labels (text above groups)                      | 30                        |
| Main          | Primary flow components                               | 60–300                    |
| Below-group   | Components outside a group but at the same flow stage | Below group bottom + 80px |
| Cross-cutting | Supporting services row                               | Main bottom + 120px       |

### Edge Rules

- **Orthogonal edges only**: All edges must use horizontal and vertical segments only — never diagonal. Use `edgeStyle=orthogonalEdgeStyle` (the default).
- **Do NOT specify edge anchor points**: Never set `entryX`, `entryY`, `exitX`, `exitY`, `entryDx`, `entryDy`, `exitDx`, or `exitDy` on edges. The server automatically calculates optimal anchor points based on relative component positions. Hardcoded anchors cause misalignment when components move. Let the server handle it.
- **Edge connection points — prefer sides**: Edges should exit and enter components through their **left or right sides**, not through the top or bottom. This aligns with the left-to-right flow direction. Use top/bottom connections only for vertically stacked sibling services within the same column.
- **Edge symmetry**: When multiple edges fan out from a single source, space them evenly with consistent routing. If one edge leaves from the right, sibling edges should also leave from the right.
- **Flow direction discipline**: The primary flow is left-to-right, secondary is top-to-bottom. Edges must never originate going **upward** or **leftward**. Reposition targets rather than drawing backwards edges.
- **CRITICAL: One edge per source into a group**: When a source connects to children inside a group, draw exactly **one edge** targeting the **group cell itself** — never draw edges directly to children inside the group. If a different source also connects to the group, it gets its own separate edge.
- **Edges represent data/request flow only**: Only draw edges between services in the direct request or data path. Do not draw edges for indirect relationships (DNS resolution, image pulls, secrets, monitoring, auth).
- **Edges must not cross group boundaries they don't belong to**: An edge may only enter/exit a group if its source or target is a child. Leave at least 60px clearance around groups for clean routing.

### Group Rules

- **Group children must be visually inside their container**: ALL children must be positioned within the group's visible boundary. Size groups large enough to contain every child with padding. Stack sibling children vertically.
- **ALL compute resources of a workload belong inside the workload's group**: If a workload has a Container Apps Environment with Container Apps AND an App Service, both the Container Apps and the App Service are children of the group. Do NOT place any compute resource of the workload outside its group. If a resource logically belongs to the workload, it goes inside the group.
- **Group labels go above, not inside**: The group's own `text`/`value` must be set to the desired visible label (e.g., "Container Apps Environment"). Additionally, create a **separate bold text vertex** positioned above the group rectangle with the workload name (e.g., "Workload A"). This text cell is NOT a child of the group — it sits at the layer level above the group's top edge.
- **Group `text` parameter**: When calling `create-groups`, always provide a descriptive `text` value for the group (e.g., `"Container Apps Environment"`, `"VNet"`, `"Subnet"`). Never pass `text: ""` — the group should self-describe what it represents.

### Branching & Routing Around Groups

- **Branch before entering containers**: When a source connects to targets both inside and outside a group, draw **separate edges**. One enters the group (targeting the group cell). Others route **around** the group — below or beside it — never through it.
- **Position outside-group targets below the group**: Components outside a group that receive edges from the same source as group children should be placed **below** the group (higher y-coordinate), not beside it at the same height. This enables clean orthogonal routing around the group. They should be **horizontally centered** relative to the group above them (i.e., sharing the same center x-coordinate).

### Cross-Cutting & Supporting Services

- **Cross-cutting services** (Azure Monitor, Microsoft Entra ID, Azure Key Vault, Azure Policy, Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Azure Container Registry, DNS Zones, Application Insights, Log Analytics Workspaces) are placed in a **row along the bottom** of the diagram, well below the main flow (at least 120px below the lowest main-flow component).
- **CRITICAL**: Do **NOT** draw edges/lines from any main-flow component to cross-cutting services. Do **NOT** place them in the primary left-to-right flow path. Their role is implied by their presence. For example, do not draw edges from a Container App to a Container Registry, and do not add "Pull Image" labels.
- **Cross-cutting services MUST have labels**: Every cross-cutting service vertex must have a descriptive `text` label (e.g., "Azure Monitor", "Key Vault", "Entra ID"). Never leave them unlabeled. The label is the only way the reader knows what the icon represents.
- DNS Zones must **never** appear in the main flow path — they are cross-cutting infrastructure.

## Shape Selection

- Use stencils for all architecture components. Do not use basic shapes (rectangles, circles, etc.) to represent Azure or cloud services. Basic shapes are fine for flowcharts and general diagrams.
- Default to Azure icons and context for architecture diagrams unless otherwise specified. Use official Azure icons and colors for all components.
- **Azure icon naming**: Azure icons use their official Azure service names, often in plural form (e.g., "Front Doors", "Container Apps", "App Services", "Key Vaults", "Virtual Networks", "DNS Zones", "Log Analytics Workspaces"). When searching, use the full Azure service name — not abbreviations, generic terms, or single words like "azure". The fuzzy search is tolerant of singular/plural and minor variations, but more specific queries yield better results.
- **Search, don't guess**: Always call `search-shapes` before adding shapes. Include **all** shapes in a single call — main flow components **and** cross-cutting / supporting services (Monitor, Entra ID, Key Vault, Azure Policy, Defender for Cloud, Container Registry, etc.). Do NOT defer cross-cutting services to a second call. Review the results to confirm the matched shape name and use that exact name with `add-cells` (set `shape_name` on vertices).
- **Plan ALL components upfront**: Before making any tool calls, create a complete inventory of every component in the diagram — main flow AND cross-cutting. Assign each a position, label, and group membership. Then execute the batch workflow. Do not improvise during tool calls.

## Styling

- Call `get-style-presets` once to retrieve Azure, flowchart, and general color presets, then apply them consistently.

## Labels & Annotations

### Mandatory Labeling — Every Icon Must Have a Label

- **Every vertex with `shape_name` MUST have a meaningful `text` label.** The server will fall back to the shape's display name if `text` is omitted or empty, but you should always provide an explicit, human-friendly label. Examples: "Front Door", "Web App", "API", "Cosmos DB", "Azure Monitor", "Key Vault".
- **Never pass `text: ""`** for any shaped vertex. If you don't have a custom name, simply omit the `text` parameter and the server will use the shape's display name automatically.
- **Custom labels are better than defaults**: For compute resources, use role-based names like "Web" and "API" rather than generic service names. For cross-cutting services, use the Azure service name (e.g., "Azure Monitor", "Key Vault", "Entra ID").

### Edge Labels

- Add labels for traffic paths (e.g., "HTTPS", "gRPC") on edges where they clarify the flow.
- **Edge label placement**: Place labels **above** horizontal edges and **to the left** of vertical edges. Use `verticalAlign=bottom;labelBackgroundColor=none;` in the edge style to position labels above horizontal segments.
- Labels must never overlap shapes or other labels.

### External Endpoint Labels

- When a component serves external users (e.g., Front Door with a custom domain), create a **separate text vertex** to the left of the component with the URL/endpoint.
- **Domain name formatting rules**:
  - Domain names must be **plain text on a single line** — no line breaks, no `\n`, no `&#10;`.
  - Write the full domain as one string: `workload-a.contoso.com`.
  - Never insert line breaks into domain names. They are short enough to fit on one line.
  - Use `fontSize=11` and `align=right` for endpoint labels, with the label positioned to the left of the entry-point icon.

### Spacing & Overlap Prevention

- Minimum spacing: **120px horizontal** between columns, **80px vertical** between rows.
- If labels collide, increase spacing or reposition components. Do not reduce font size.
- Do **not** add annotation labels for implied relationships like "DNS Resolution", "Image Pull", or "Secret Access" — these are covered by the presence of cross-cutting services.

## CRITICAL — Batch-Only Workflow

**Every tool that accepts an array MUST be called exactly ONCE with ALL items. NEVER call a tool repeatedly for individual items.**

Before making ANY tool calls, plan the entire diagram: identify all shapes, groups, edges, and assignments. Then execute using the fewest possible calls.

### Step 1 — Search all shapes ONCE

Call `search-shapes` exactly **ONE time** with the **`queries` array parameter** listing **every** shape name you need — basic shapes, Azure icons for the main flow, **AND** cross-cutting / supporting services (Monitor, Entra ID, Key Vault, Azure Policy, Defender for Cloud, Container Registry, DNS Zones, etc.). Plan the entire diagram first, then submit ONE search with ALL queries. Do NOT split shapes across multiple `search-shapes` calls — not even for cross-cutting services. If you realize you forgot a shape later, you may make one additional call, but the goal is always a single call.

**CRITICAL**: The `queries` parameter is **required** and must be an **array of strings**. Example:

```json
{
  "queries": [
    "rectangle",
    "diamond",
    "front door",
    "container apps",
    "app service",
    "key vault",
    "dns zone",
    "monitor",
    "entra id",
    "azure policy",
    "container registry"
  ]
}
```

### Step 2 — Create all groups in ONE call FIRST

Call `create-groups` exactly **ONE time** with every group/container (VNets, subnets, resource groups, Container Apps Environments, etc.). **Groups must be created before the components that will go inside them**, so you can calculate the proper group size based on the number and placement of children. Leave adequate padding (at least 20px on each side).

**CRITICAL**: Always provide a descriptive `text` label for every group. Never use `text: ""`.

**Sizing formula**: For N children stacked vertically inside a group (each ~48px tall with 40px gaps):

- Width: child width (48px) + 80px horizontal padding = **~180px minimum** (wider for children with long labels)
- Height: N × 48 + (N-1) × 40 + 80px vertical padding = **~(N × 88 + 40)px**

```json
{
  "groups": [
    { "text": "Container Apps Environment", "x": 380, "y": 60, "width": 180, "height": 216, "temp_id": "env" },
    { "text": "VNet", "x": 340, "y": 20, "width": 300, "height": 300, "temp_id": "vnet" }
  ]
}
```

### Step 3 — Create all cells (vertices and edges) in ONE call

Call `add-cells` exactly **ONE time** with every vertex and edge in a single `cells` array. Use `shape_name` on vertices to resolve Azure icons and basic shapes automatically.

**CRITICAL — When using `shape_name`, do NOT specify `width`, `height`, or `style`**: The server automatically uses the correct dimensions and styling from the shape library. Any width/height you provide will be **ignored**. Only specify `x`, `y`, `text`, and `temp_id` for shaped vertices.

**CRITICAL — Every shaped vertex MUST have a `text` label or omit `text` entirely**: Never pass `text: ""`. Either provide a descriptive label (e.g., `text: "Web"`) or omit `text` and the server will use the shape's display name. Passing an empty string defeats the automatic labeling.

**CRITICAL — Edges MUST NOT specify anchor points**: Never set `entryX`, `entryY`, `exitX`, `exitY`, `entryDx`, `entryDy`, `exitDx`, or `exitDy` in edge styles. The server calculates optimal anchors automatically. Hardcoded anchors cause misalignment.

**Ordering requirement — vertices before edges:** Within the `cells` array, all vertices that are referenced by edges MUST appear **before** those edges. Edges reference vertices via `source_id` and `target_id`, which must match a `temp_id` defined on a vertex earlier in the array (or an existing cell ID from a previous call). If an edge references a `temp_id` that has not yet appeared, the entire batch will fail validation. **Never split vertices and edges into separate `add-cells` calls** — include them all in one call with correct ordering.

**Every vertex that will be an edge endpoint MUST have a `temp_id`** so edges can reference it via `source_id` / `target_id`.

```json
{
  "cells": [
    // External endpoint label — plain text, single line, NO line breaks in domain names
    {
      "type": "vertex",
      "x": 50,
      "y": 110,
      "width": 130,
      "height": 30,
      "text": "workload-a.contoso.com",
      "style": "text;fontSize=11;fontColor=#666666;align=right;verticalAlign=middle;"
    },
    // Vertices — only x, y, shape_name, text, temp_id (NO width/height, NO style)
    { "type": "vertex", "shape_name": "Front Doors", "x": 200, "y": 100, "text": "Front Door", "temp_id": "fd" },
    { "type": "vertex", "shape_name": "Container Apps", "x": 420, "y": 80, "text": "Web", "temp_id": "web" },
    { "type": "vertex", "shape_name": "Container Apps", "x": 420, "y": 168, "text": "API", "temp_id": "api" },
    { "type": "vertex", "shape_name": "App Services", "x": 420, "y": 300, "text": "Legacy API", "temp_id": "legacy" },
    // Cross-cutting services — always include text labels
    { "type": "vertex", "shape_name": "Monitor", "x": 200, "y": 450, "text": "Azure Monitor" },
    { "type": "vertex", "shape_name": "Key Vaults", "x": 350, "y": 450, "text": "Key Vault" },
    // Edges — NO style overrides, NO anchor points, just source/target/text
    { "type": "edge", "source_id": "fd", "target_id": "web", "text": "HTTPS" }
  ]
}
```

**Important — use actual cell IDs from the response:** The `add-cells` response returns each cell's **actual ID** (e.g., `cell-2` in default mode, or `placeholder-front-doors-abc123` in transactional mode). In subsequent tool calls (`add-cells-to-group`, `edit-cells`, etc.), you **MUST** use these actual IDs from the response — not the original `temp_id` values. The `temp_id` is only for cross-referencing **within** the same `add-cells` batch.

### Step 4 — Assign all cells to groups in ONE call

Call `add-cells-to-group` exactly **ONE time** with every cell-to-group assignment. Use the **actual cell IDs and group IDs from the responses** of `add-cells` (Step 3) and `create-groups` (Step 2).

```
add-cells-to-group({ assignments: [
  {cell_id: "<actual cell ID from add-cells response>", group_id: "<actual group ID from create-groups response>"}
] })
```

### Step 5 — Edit cells, edges, or apply shapes in ONE call

Call `edit-cells`, `edit-edges`, or `set-cell-shape` exactly **ONE time** with all updates.

### Quick reference — always use ONE call with arrays

| `add-cells-to-group`         | `assignments`   | Assign cells to groups                   |
| `validate-group-containment` | n/a             | Detect out-of-bounds children in a group |
| `suggest-group-sizing`       | n/a             | Estimate recommended group width/height  |

## Containment & Layers

- Use `create-groups` to create all containers in one call. Size each group large enough to contain all its children with at least 20px padding on each side.
- Use `add-cells-to-group` to assign all children in one call.
- **Coordinate model (CRITICAL)**:
  - Cells created at layer level (`parent="1"` or a layer ID) use **absolute canvas coordinates**.
  - Cells inside groups (`parent="<group-id>"`) use **coordinates relative to the group's top-left corner**.
  - When moving a cell into a group, preserve absolute visual placement by converting coordinates to group-relative values.
  - When moving a cell out of a group, convert back to absolute layer coordinates.
- Position children so they are visually inside the container with padding. Stack sibling children vertically where appropriate.
- Use `validate-group-containment` after assignments to detect children that exceed group bounds.
- Use `suggest-group-sizing` before `create-groups` to estimate width/height from child count, spacing, and padding.

## Import / Export

- To modify an existing `.drawio` file, read its XML content and pass it to `import-diagram`, make changes, then `export-diagram` to get the updated XML.
- Always save exported XML to a `.drawio` file.
- **Prefer compressed export**: When calling `export-diagram`, pass `compress: true` to reduce payload size by 60-80%. The server uses **deflate-raw** compression with **base64** encoding — the same format used by the Draw.io desktop app. Compressed `.drawio` files are fully compatible with Draw.io and can be re-imported without any special handling.
- The response from `export-diagram` includes a `compression` object indicating whether compression is enabled and, when enabled, the `algorithm` (`deflate-raw`) and `encoding` (`base64`) used.
- `import-diagram` automatically detects and decompresses compressed content — no extra parameters needed.

### Saving .drawio Files Efficiently

When `export-diagram` returns a large result that gets written to a temporary `content.json` file, do NOT call `read_file` to read it back through the LLM. The exported XML does not need LLM comprehension — reading it back creates an expensive and slow cloud round-trip where the full payload is uploaded to the model and then written back down via `create_file`.

Instead, use a **local terminal command** to extract the `xml` property from the JSON and write the `.drawio` file directly on the user's machine:

**PowerShell (Windows):**

```powershell
$json = Get-Content '<temp-content-json-path>' -Raw | ConvertFrom-Json; $json.data.xml | Set-Content '<output-path>.drawio' -Encoding UTF8 -NoNewline
```

**Bash (macOS/Linux):**

```bash
cat '<temp-content-json-path>' | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['data']['xml'], end='')" > '<output-path>.drawio'
```

This approach:

- Keeps the exported diagram data entirely local — no upload to the LLM
- Eliminates the slowest step in the diagram generation workflow
- Produces identical output to the read-and-create approach

Always prefer this local extraction pattern when saving exported diagrams to `.drawio` files.
