        Thank you for reporting a diagram issue! To help us investigate and improve diagram generation, please attach both:

        - **File A** — The `.drawio` file **as generated by the MCP server** (before any manual edits).
        - **File B** — The `.drawio` file **after your adjustments** to show what you wanted it to look like.

        Comparing these two files lets us pinpoint what the server got wrong and evaluate what adjustments are needed.
